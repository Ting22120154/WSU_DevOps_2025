# Website Health Monitor
This project uses **AWS Lambda + CloudWatch + EventBridge** to monitor website uptime and performance. It:

---

## Features
- Checks website every 5 minutes  
- Publishes custom metrics to CloudWatch  
- Dashboard auto-generated  
- Sends email alerts via SNS

## About me
Hi! I'm TING. I am building a cloud-based website monitoring system using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch.

## Installation & Deployment

To deploy this monitoring system in your AWS environment:

1. **Install prerequisites**:
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   - [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
   - [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html)
   - Python 3.12

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ting22120154/WSU_DevOps_2025.git
   cd WSU_DevOps_2025
   ```

3. **Bootstrap the CDK** (only once per AWS account/region):
   ```bash
   cdk bootstrap
   ```

4. **Deploy the stack**:
   ```bash
   cdk deploy
   ```

5. **Confirm email subscription**:
   - Check your inbox and **confirm** the SNS subscription request to receive alerts.

##  Lambda Function Overview

This project uses an AWS Lambda function to check the health of websites.

For each URL in the list, the Lambda:

1. Sends an HTTP request using Python's `urllib`.
2. Measures:
   - Response Latency (how long it takes)
   - Response Size
   - Success (1) or Failure (0)
   - HTTP Status Code
3. Sends these metrics to CloudWatch.
4. Returns a human-readable report (used for alerts or debugging).

The function runs every 5 minutes, triggered by an EventBridge rule.

## Metrics Tracked

The Lambda function sends 4 key metrics to CloudWatch under the namespace `WebsiteMonitor`:

| Metric Name    | Description                           | Unit     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|----------|
| `Latency`      | How long the website took to respond  | Seconds  |
| `IsSuccess`    | 1 if response is 2xx, else 0          | Count    |
| `StatusCode`   | HTTP status code of the response      | None     |
| `ResponseSize` | Size of the webpage content           | Bytes    |

These are visualized in the CloudWatch dashboard and used to trigger alarms.

##  Email Alerts

When an alarm is triggered (e.g. a website is down or slow), an email is sent via Amazon SNS.

### How to receive email alerts:

1. In `app.py`, update the `alarm_emails` list with your email address.
2. Deploy the stack.
3. Go to your inbox and confirm the subscription (check spam folder).
4. Done!  Youâ€™ll now get alerts like:
